Stack
	- Use stack to write a program that reads a string and determines whether it is a palindrome.
	- global variables: String input, Stack<Character> charStack
	- Methods: 
		fillStack() - Create a stack of characters from string.  (Hint: loop)
		buildReverse() - Create a string by popping off Stack
		isPalindrome() - Is input equal to result of build reverse?
	-Test:
		kayak  // "I saw I was I" // “Able was I ere I saw Elba”		
		"Level madam level" // Your name or what ever else you want to.

	- Use stack to balance parentheses 
		- Create a stack to hold open parentheses and brackets.
		- Create a method isBalanced(String)
		- Loop through input one character at a time, adding open elements.
		- If it's a closed element, check top of stack, if there isn't an open matching return false (Not balanced)
		- If matches, pop off the top and continue loop.
		- When entire string is parsed, check if stack is empty.
