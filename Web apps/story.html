<h3>Take care of yourself</h2>
<p >Valerie studies at a big university. At the same time, she maintains a full-time job so
that she can pay for her tuition and her living expenses. So, Valerie spends most of the
day at the office, then goes to class three days a week. She also stays up late at night to
study for her classes.</p>
<h4 style="color:red">Valerie does not do any physical exercise. Between work and university, she is
so busy that she thinks she does not have time for any physical activity.</h3>
<p>Sadly, she rarely eats home-made meals. She usually just grabs a bag of chips or a 
hamburger as she leaves her office to take the bus to university. Since she is convinced
that she does not have time to make a healthy dinner when she gets home, she eats
lots of pizzas that she orders over the phone.</p>
<a href=".\story.html">After dinner, she starts studying and preparing her assignments. Valerie does not sleep
very much because of it. She feels grumpy when she wakes up early in the morning,
and she is irritable at work. After her long day, she feels tired in class, and it is hard for
her to concentrate.
